##Opportunity
EM volumes will become substantially larger in the future due to increases in imaging throughput[1]. 
The ever-increasing resolution of datasets  allows for more refined understanding networks involved[3][4]. 
Algorithms to find relationships between the 3D distributions of synapses may be able to generate novel conclusions.

##Significance
Utilizing novel algorithms may allow us to generate more complete models of how neuronal circuits process information. 
By understanding the 3D distribution of synapses, it will allow a better understanding of the underlying neural circuitry, which will aid in better treatments. 
While there are current methods for determining the placement of deep brain stimulation electrodes, this would help in better determining the best location to target and wider implications of how it may disrupt a network[5]. 
This research may also prove helpful in gaining a larger picture view of the brain, as current methods look at microscopic circuitry, limiting the understanding of the wider range of networks our minds operate in[6][7]. 
By understanding the distribution of the synapses, it may help with tying structure to function[7]. 

##Feasibility
Algorithms to generate signal pathways have already been implemented, which utilize well-established tools for tracking synapses[2]. 
Datasets for such algorithms already exist and will only become more refined. 
Within the scope of this project, we expect to generate potentially unique statistics resulting from synapse density. 
Possible progress includes new visual representations of the networks. 
This may allow us to draw different patterns regarding density and distribution of neural networks. 

##Innovation
If successful, the novel conclusions and models established will apply to all relevant research. 
It may also more fully define the relationship between different classes of synaptic targets (inhibitory vs. excitatory). 
This will allow for a more thorough analysis of data from previous and future neurological studies, 
and results may be able to be utilized for a finer understanding and control to modulate brain-state.
